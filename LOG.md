- Enhanced Docker container setup with proper volume mounts for tests
- Improved project structure following testing best practices

### Text Interaction

- Implementing position tracking system for reliable annotation placement
- Creating color-coding system for different types of highlights

### 2025-03-06 20:34: EPUB Reader Implementation
- Created reader interface with chapter navigation and page controls
- Implemented theme switching (light, dark, and sepia modes)
- Added font size adjustments for better reading experience
- Designed annotation system for highlighting and taking notes
- Built JavaScript functionality for loading book content dynamically
- Implemented persistent reading state to remember user's position
- Added API endpoints for spine retrieval and content processing

### 2025-03-06 20:38: Library Management
- Created library interface for book management
- Implemented book upload with EPUB processing
- Added reading progress tracking on book cards
- Created homepage with recent books section
- Implemented responsive design for all screen sizes
- Added metadata extraction on book upload

### 2025-03-06 20:42: Reader State Management
- Implemented complete reading state API endpoint in reader.py
- Added position tracking with format "spineIndex:elementIndex"
- Implemented "is_finished" flag for tracking book completion
- Ensured timestamp updates on every state change
- Created proper JSON response format for AJAX handlers

### 2025-03-06 20:45: Test Suite for Reader
- Implemented tests for reader page loading and API endpoints
- Tested 404 response for invalid book IDs
- Verified book spine and content retrieval functionality
- Validated reading state update mechanism

### 2025-03-06 21:05: Fixed Reader API and Content Processing Issues
